Inter-Domain Supervised Clustering Framework

Part of the code that I wrote for my PhD

Algorithms:

1. K-means with different distance (similarity) measures.
2. Hidden Markov Random Fields (HMRF) K-means, based on "A Probabilistic Framework for Semi-Supervised Clustering" by Sugato Basu, Mikhail Bilenko, and Raymond J. Mooney

Validation Indices:

1. Normalized Mutual Information (NMI)
2. Daviesâ€“Bouldin index
3. Dunn`s index
4. Silhouette index

+ Plus a bunch of very useful utils that can help you.
